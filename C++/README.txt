In my first few months of programming in C++, I had a professor who loved
linux, and by default, used eclipse instead of VS. Although I am not impartial 
to linux, I simply was more used to windows, and so halfway through, switched to VS 
for my IDE.

Anyway, long story short, all the VS cpp files should cross compile because I was submitting
them to a professor who used a Linux compiler, and I used windows cpp compiler.

However, the files in eclipse will probably not play nicely with a windows compiler, although
they very well could.

Bonus fun surprise: canball and palindrome are both in fact C programs. I just noticed
them as I was cherry picking nice assignments from my eclipse workspace.

In fact, I actually have 4 months of experience as a C developer, but I'm not exactly confident
enough in it to advertise myself as such
