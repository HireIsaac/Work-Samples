**EDIT:**
Something funky has happened to my code that I never noticed until I was redoing it to use
a template and proper pop. I *think* it could be that my head is not moving properly.
As you can see from output of code, when I pop something it works, but when I push the
order things are displayed is the exact same. Anyway, I noticed on D2L that you wanted us to
use templates, so I am resubmitting before tonight ends, and I also noticed that the description
for pop on d2l was wrong, and was in fact the description for top(I believe).

I will tinker with it a bit on the weekend to try to figure out my misplaced head, and if I can't
I will just bring it in to your office. 

**/EDIT**


Compiled in windows compiler, removed pch.h dependencies for cross compilation.

To use, simply run simpleStack.cpp in your prefered IDE.  

I feel my solution is fairly correct / efficient, the operator works, the added print function
works, and from the testing I did, I fixed all the errors I had. My pop() used to give me
the address of the top, but I found out how to fix that really easily, I was just not being
the smartest in my code. 

Cheers,
Isaac
